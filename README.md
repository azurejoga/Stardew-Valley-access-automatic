### Automation of Mod Installation for Accessibility in Stardew Valley for the blind and visually impaired

This script is a mod installation automation tool to add accessibility to the Stardew Valley game. In addition to configuring accessibility mods, the script also installs [SMAPI](smapi.io) (Stardew Modding API), an essential mod loader to ensure correct functioning of mods in the game. It simplifies the entire installation process, allowing visually impaired players to fully enjoy the gaming experience.
## What does the script do?
1. download and extract SMAPI, if you have already downloaded it, just run the .bat, you can skip this installation step.
2. Configure the mods folder. Asks the user what the mod folder is for installing [stardew-access](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/stardew-access) and [project fluent](https://github.com/projectfluent) Alternatively : if the folder does not open, use alt + tabe to find the window and set the folder.
3. Download, extract, and move all the necessary mods to the Stardew Valley mods folder you chose.
4. Run the game after installing.
5. Create desktop shortcut and enable achievements

## Important...
After you install the game on Steam, run it at least once so that all changes take effect later after running the script. You need to run the game at least once, otherwise it won't work.
